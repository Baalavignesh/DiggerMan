Digging Clicker Game
A browser-based incremental clicker game where players dig deeper into the earth to collect resources and upgrade their tools.
Game Concept
Players start with a basic wooden shovel and dig deeper by clicking. As they progress, they earn "Dirt" (the main resource) which can be spent on better tools and auto-diggers. The game features infinite depth progression with different biomes and increasingly powerful equipment.
